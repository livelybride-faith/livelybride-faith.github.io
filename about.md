### A little about me

Hello, my name is Michelle, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ. 

> Sometimes people confuse truth as rudeness and lies as politeness.

It is strange,
to think that I’ve learned what it meant in the past,
only to learn again that I did not fully understand.
I wonder how much more there is to learn and to break,
only to find out there is more.
